### What problem this route solves

| **Stakeholder pain-point**                                        | **What you get from the endpoint**                                                                                               |
|------------------------------------------------------------------ |--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Analysts spend hours building SKU performance write-ups           | `response.report_text` → multi-section report (inventory, unit economics, channel & regional sales, patterns, recs, next steps). |
| Need to justify inventory levels                                  | Section *Product & Inventory Overview* flags whether stock > safety / ROP.                                                       |
| Sales & ops teams need single source for channel vs region splits | Report highlights discrepancies and calls out alignment actions.                                                                 |
| Execs want actionable steps not raw data                          | Built-in *Recommendations and Next Steps* lists.                                                                                 |

| `inventory_snapshot`   | object         | ✔︎           | Needs `current_stock_units`, `safety_stock_units`, `reorder_point_units`. |
| `unit_economics`       | object         | ✔︎           | Requires `unit_cost`, `unit_price`.                                       |
| `purchases[]`          | array          | ✱            | Purchase history (date, qty, supplier) enhances the purchasing section.   |

| `daily_sales_history[]`| array          | ✱            | Use as many days as you have; the LLM summarises patterns automatically.  |
| `metadata`             | object         | ✱            | Echoed back for traceability (prep timestamp, source system).             |

 ✱ = optional but highly recommended for a richer report.

**Shortcut:** dump the same JSON you already generate for your BI dashboard—the model ignores fields it doesn’t recognise.

        "report_text": "Business Analysis Report: Smart LED Bulb 9 W – Wi‑Fi (E27)\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n1. Product and Inventory Overview  \n─────────────────────────────  \n• Product Details:  \n  – Product Code: 56421  \n  – Product Name: Smart LED Bulb 9 W – Wi‑Fi (E27)  \n  – Category: Lighting > Smart Home  \n  – Unit of Measure: unit\n\n• Inventory Snapshot as of 2024-03-31:  \n  – Current Stock: 780 units  \n  – Safety Stock: 300 units  \n  – Reorder Point: 450 units  \n  Observation: The current inventory level (780 units) is above both the safety stock level and the reorder point. No immediate replenishment appears necessary based solely on the provided inventory thresholds.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n2. Unit Economics and Purchasing  \n─────────────────────────────  \n• Unit Economics:  \n  – Unit Cost: $2.65  \n  – Unit Price: $6.90  \n  Observation: The difference between the unit price and cost is $4.25, indicating a positive margin per unit sold.\n\n• Purchase History:  \n  – 2024-01-08: 1,000 units from LumiTech Ltd.  \n  – 2024-02-12: 900 units from LumiTech Ltd.  \n  – 2024-03-15: 850 units from BrightSource Inc.  \n  Observation: Purchases have been made consistently over the first quarter of 2024, with two transactions from one supplier and a more recent purchase from an alternate supplier. The total units purchased sum to 2,750.\n\n• Returns Data:  \n  – 2024-02-27: 19 units returned due to a factory defect  \n  – 2024-03-18: 11 units returned due to buyer remorse  \n  Observation: Returns are minimal compared to overall purchase volumes (a total of 30 units), indicating generally acceptable product quality and customer satisfaction levels based on the reasons provided.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n3. Sales Analysis  \n─────────────────────────────\n\nA. Channel Sales  \n  – Ecommerce: 2,460 units  \n  – Retail Stores: 890 units  \n  – Marketplace: 610 units  \n  – Wholesale: 430 units  \n  Observation: Ecommerce is the dominant sales channel, contributing more than half of the combined sales units from the four channels (total channel sales: 4,390 units). Retail stores and marketplaces also contribute significant volumes, while wholesale represents the smallest channel among those recorded.\n\nB. Regional Sales  \n  – North America: 1,820 units  \n  – Europe: 1,100 units  \n  – Latin America: 720 units  \n  – Asia Pacific: 550 units  \n  – Middle East & Africa: 100 units  \n  Observation: Sales are highest in North America followed by Europe. The data indicates a relatively lower volume in the Middle East & Africa region. The total regional sales add up to 4,290 units, which is close to channel sales but not identical—a slight discrepancy that suggests different aggregation criteria or reporting methods between channels and regions.\n\nC. Daily Sales History (Selected Dates)  \n  – January Sales: Daily recorded units on specific dates total 203 units within the provided subset  \n  – February Sales: Daily recorded units on selected dates total 157 units  \n  – March Sales: Daily recorded units on selected dates total 179 units  \n  Observation: The daily sales figures, although limited in scope, show variability in daily performance. The sample indicates a gradual increase in unit sales from January to March on the specific dates recorded.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n4. Correlations and Patterns  \n─────────────────────────────  \n• Inventory and Purchasing:  \n  – The current inventory level exceeds both the safety stock and reorder point, suggesting that recent purchasing events have sufficiently replenished the inventory relative to the demand encountered.\n\n• Unit Economics and Sales Channels:  \n  – The favorable margin ($4.25 per unit) likely supports maintaining diverse sales channels. The dominance of ecommerce sales may indicate a successful online strategy for this product.\n\n• Purchase Timing and Returns:  \n  – Purchases spread over the first quarter have managed to maintain inventory levels, even after accounting for returns. Returns remain low relative to purchase volumes, which could indicate that quality issues are isolated or limited in impact.\n\n• Sales Distribution:  \n  – There is consistency in recorded sales across channels and regions, though slight variations exist in total unit counts. Differences between channel and regional totals suggest that further alignment in sales tracking may be beneficial for a more integrated view.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n5. Recommendations  \n─────────────────────────────  \n• Monitor Inventory Levels:  \n  – Continue regular monitoring to ensure that stock remains above both safety and reorder thresholds, especially as sales volumes are strong.\n\n• Maintain Focus on Ecommerce:  \n  – Given the leading role of ecommerce in channel sales, consider further investments in digital marketing and online sales optimization.\n\n• Evaluate Regional Performance:  \n  – Explore strategies to boost sales in lower-performing regions such as the Middle East & Africa, while continuing to support strong regions like North America and Europe.\n\n• Align Reporting Metrics:  \n  – Review the methodology of aggregating channel versus regional sales to understand and reconcile the slight discrepancy in total units.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n6. Next Steps  \n─────────────────────────────  \n• Expand Daily Sales Analysis:  \n  – Gather more comprehensive daily sales data over the full periods to better understand demand trends and seasonality.\n\n• Supplier Performance Review:  \n  – Analyze any recurring patterns in purchase quantities, supplier performance, and returns to determine if changes in supplier engagement strategies are needed.\n\n• Integrate Sales Data:  \n  – Evaluate the alignment between various sales reporting metrics (channel and regional) to support more accurate forecasting and decision-making.\n\n• Continued Quality Monitoring:  \n  – Monitor returned units more closely to identify any patterns that could impact inventory planning or quality assurance processes.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nConclusion  \n─────────────────────────────  \nThe data indicate a well-performing product with strong sales figures, a healthy inventory position, and a favorable unit margin. While the current purchasing and sales patterns appear effective, further analysis on daily trends, data reconciliation between channels and regions, and supplier evaluation could provide additional actionable insights.",
